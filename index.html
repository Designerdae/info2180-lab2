 <h2>How did I go from Business to Computing?</h2><h5>October 2, 2021 by Dana Edwards</h5>
 <p> 
     <img src="journey.jpg" alt="journey"style="float:right;width:200px;height:200px;">

     Hi! I'm Dana also known as "D" or "Dae" and I fell for computing.
     I attended the Convent of Mercy Academy 'Alpha,'and as early as first form,
     we were introduced to Information technology. I took an interest in this since
     then and continued to pursue it. However, as I progressed through high school, 
     I also developed a liking for business the more I explored, minus the accounts 
     part. "Ensure you get the balance," it's a no from me, nonetheless I passed. 
     It was around fourth form when it was time to answer the question, what do you 
     want to do? My school grouped a set number of subjects together for each class 
     and everyone from that class would do the same subjects. Funny enough, I chose 
     a science class, but my coordinator at the time said to me that she feels I would
     do well in the business class, which also had I.T. At first, I was put off like what? 
     you could do that? but, I took her advice and I must say, I dont regret it. </p>
  <p>
     Throughout liking business, my interest for Information technology grew, I was enjoying it 
     so much that at one point, I didnt even have to study for tests. SBAs were stressful but I 
     enjoyed it nonetheless, I actually scored full marks on my I.T. IA! Ofcourse, when it was time 
     to apply for university, it was a no brainer, Information technology was my first choice and 
     Entrepreneurship as my second. Very quick, I got accepted to Entrepreneurship and my reaction? 
     I thought cool, going to UWI but the excitement wasn't at its peak. A couple months later, 
     coincidentally, I'm in I.T. class and I stumbled upon an email from UWI. I got accepted to the I.T. 
     program! I was elated, I almost screamed in class :D. That is when I thought to myself, let the 
     journey begin, I don't know where in tech I will go, but I want to be there. </p>

 <h2>You made it, What's next?</h2><h5>October 2, 2021 by Dana Edwards</h5>
 <p> 
     <img src="uxweb.jpg" alt="journey"style="float:left;width:200px;height:200px;">
     Just as many freshers at the begnning of university, I was beaming with excitement, ready
     to start my journey. Sparkles in my eyes if you will, and then the workload came and said 
     hey are you ready for me? Maybe I wasn't so ready. I orginally came to pursue Information 
     technology but after making comparisons, asking questions and so forth, I switched to a
     Computer Science major. I knew tech was where I wanted to be, but the extensive math was 
     a struggle. </p>
 <p>
     I thought, is that all there is to Computing? there must be something that would 
     suit me here. I began to research and I discovered UX/UI Design. Bingo! this is something that 
     intrigued me. Plus, I already liked to dabble in a bit of design with posters and logos, seeing what
     colour combinations worked well, and creating 'pleasing to the eye'designs. I try to manage my time 
     wisely, but sometimes it doesn't work out so well. However, this summer, I took an introductory course
     on User Experience online, to grasp what it entailed and if it was for me. I enjoyed it and decided this
     is something I see myself doing. As it relates to Web Development, I got a small taste of it, in high school
     and I found it really cool, got excited over changing the colour of a font and so on. But, the interest grew 
     more recently,from doing Web Development labs. It didn't feel like a drag to do the lab, it was an oportunity to
     know more and have fun. As such, my journey to becoming a UX/UI Designer and Web Developer is looking promising. </p>
